        I'm making it to not only get a better grasp on the deployment of websites via hostinger and DNS resolution but
        to also have a "lab" type environment to mess around with.  I my next dev post and push will definitley have to do with PHP
        because its incredibly annoying to have to not only copy and paste the header and footer on to every page, but when
        I inevitably make a change to the header or footer, I have to go through every page and make the change.  I know there is a way
        and even though I was given advice not to care about the way the website looks as much, the perfectionist in me is not having it lol. 
        <br></br>(not perfectionist enough to fix grammer and run-on sentences though)

        I started building this website on March 20th 2025 and it has come a hilariously long way in two days
        I can actually look at the website without stale facing from the color scheme. To go from where it is in the image 
        below to where it is now is a huge improvement.  I'm excited to see where this goes.

        As you can see, the image of the first rendition of the website was pretty trash, it looks like a sketchy website 
        someone made in 2006.  I tried styling it based off of a niche Visual Studio dark theme that my friend from college made.
        In my head it would have given the website a sleek and professional look that is reminiscent of a coding environment.  
        <br><em style="font-size: larger;">That did not happen.</em></br>
        So instead I decided to <s>copy</s> <em>ahem</em> take inspiration from the UI/UX masters of the world... 
        Apple.  This landed me with the current style of the website and NOW it looks professional, sleek and modern.

        After a quick look into including PHP, I would need to use a PHP server to use the includes needed for this.
        I believe it would be more fruitful to get the website hosted and then work on the PHP.
